1. In method add(Number n) before I return the sum, I assert as below to make sure that the 
Number sum just created doesn't point to null, its decimalPlaces and digitCount are in 
valid range. 
		assert ( sum !=null && sum.digitCount > 0 && sum.decimalPlaces >= 0 );
		
2. In method subtractAbsolute(Number n), after I find the largest number, I assign thisnew to 
the larger number and nnew to the other one, I make sure that they are not null with the 
following assertion: 
		assert (thisnew!=null && nnew !=null); 
		
3. In method subtract(Number n) before I return the difference, I assert as below to make sure that the 
Number difference just created doesn't point to null, its decimalPlaces and digitCount are in 
valid range.
	assert (difference != null && difference.digitCount >0 && difference.decimalPlaces >=0 );
